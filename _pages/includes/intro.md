I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the [School of Computation, Information and Technology](https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/startseite/), [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/) where I'm supervised by [Prof. Dr. Nassir Navab](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/navab-nassir) and also advised by [Dr. Tingying Peng](https://www.helmholtz.ai/themenmenue/our-research/research-groups/peng-group/index.html) and [Dr. Carsten Marr](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/aih/pi/carsten-marr) from [Helmholtz AI](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en). Prior to this I got both of my Master and Bachelor degrees from the Department of Automation at Beihang University (北京航空航天大学).

My research interests include:
